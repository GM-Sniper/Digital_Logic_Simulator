# Digital Circuit Simulator

## Overview
This project aims to develop an event-driven logic circuit simulator, providing users with the capability to create virtual representations of digital circuits and observe their behavior under different conditions without the need for physical construction. The simulator utilizes an event-driven approach to model the behavior of digital circuits based on changes in logical states, allowing for accurate representation of dynamic system behavior.
